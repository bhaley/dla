   This test verifies the mean and stddev values accumulated for multiple 
clusters in different node/thread distributions.  Each run grows 4 5000 
particle 2D lattice clusters.  The following table gives the distribution of 
clusters across threads and processes:

          MPI    Threads per  Clusters per                Wall time
  Run  Processes   process      thread                       sec
  ---  ---------   -------      ------                      ----
   1       1          1            4  (all consecutive)     126
   2       1          2            2                         75
   3       1          4            1  (all concurrent)       51
   4       2          1            2                         69
   5       2          2            1  (all concurrent)       37
   6       4          1            1  (all concurrent)       50

   Each run produces XYZ, growth, and correlation output. These outputs, along 
with the radius, radius of gyration, cappture fraction, and free steps lines in
the log files (i.e. not the growth time) should be identical.  The diff script 
compares the outputs.

   Note that this test does NOT concern the "correctness" of the output; it only
determines that the results are identical regardless of how the 4 clusters are
distributed among processes and threads.

   The results in this directory were computed on the Purdue Hansen cluster, 
using the modules specified in ./run_dla.
