   This test verifies that memory is handled cleanly in OpenDLA.  We grow a 
50 particle cluster on a 2D lattice and use Valgrind's leak check tool to
identify memory leaks.  The Valgrind invocation is

(module load valgrind)
valgrind --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes -v ../../../dla in > output 2>&1

   The output_bad result was produced on the Purdue Hansen machine using the
same build as the Accumulator verification:

module load mpich2-1.4-intel64/11.1.038 boost-intel64/1.47.0 
./configure --with-boost=/apps/rhel5/boost_1_47_0-intel64

Note that some memory is leaking in the libiomp library; this is most likely
a problem with that library on that machine.  When we recompile OpenDLA with
the additional configure flag "--without-openmp", we get the clean output in
output_good.  No memory is leaking.
